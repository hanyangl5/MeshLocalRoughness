# Mesh Local Roughness

A python program to compute and display the local roughness of a 3D mesh.

## Test the program

install required packages

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

run script

```
python meshroughness.py
```

you can also download [LIRIS/EPFL 3D Model General-Purpose database](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/guillaume.lavoue/data/datasets.html) to test the program(need to convert to .off meshes)
